# ================================================================================
# Running BLAST locally (as opposed to over the internet, see Section 7.1) has at least major two advantages:

# Local BLAST may be faster than BLAST over the internet;
# Local BLAST allows you to make your own database to search for sequences against

# Running BLAST locally
# faster
# make your own database to search for sequences against

# ================================================================================
# Dealing with proprietary or unpublished sequence data can be another reason to run BLAST locally.

# ================================================================================
# You may not be allowed to redistribute the sequences, so submitting them to the NCBI as a BLAST query would not be an option.

# ================================================================================
# Unfortunately, there are some major drawbacks too â€“ installing all the bits and getting it setup right takes some effort:

# installing all the bits of BLAST is difficult

# ================================================================================
# Local BLAST requires command line tools to be installed.

# CLI installation

# ================================================================================
# Local BLAST requires (large) BLAST databases to be setup (and potentially kept up to date).

# BLAST database (up to date)

# ================================================================================
# To further confuse matters there are several different BLAST packages available, and there are also other tools which can produce imitation BLAST output files, such as BLAT.
