How to find variants

- See video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VClehvKVw4

- /home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:19:33.png

- Small sequence read, reference sequence (bottom) as standard gene sequence
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:20:18.png

- Small sequence read is matched there
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:20:56.png
  - Meaning
    - That small sequence composed of 7 base pairs comes from that location of reference sequence

- Second small sequence read is matched there
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:22:52.png

- /home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:24:22.png

- Depth is 2 (excluding reference sequence)
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:24:38.png

- In experiment, depth can be tens of layers, such as 20, 30, and sometimes even over 100

- Suppose "substitution" applied read (substitution variant which someone has, unlike it, generally people have reference-sequence-type order)
- Normal read
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:25:59.png
- substitution applied read
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:26:53.png

- "substitution variant" is detected
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:28:07.png

- See "deletion variant"
- Normal one
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:29:08.png
- "Deletion" applied variant
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:29:50.png
- This case never be matched into any place of reference sequence
- So, read is splited, to match to reference sequence (which is called split alignment)
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:29:50.png
- "deletion" variant is detected
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:31:31.png

- See "insertion" variant
- normal
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:32:05.png
- "insertion variant" read
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:32:39.png
- Split alignment is used 
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:33:14.png
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:33:39.png

- Insertion variant is detected
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:33:51.png

================================================================================
- See another illustration for sequence alignment
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:38:31.png

- Chromosom1 as reference sequence
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:39:05.png

- One small sequence read
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:44:21.png
  - Yellow parts: sequenced part
  - Gray part: not sequenced part
  - When you have "one DNA fragment",
  machine reads it "from front to rear" and "from rear to front"
  - If "one DNA fragment" is too long (such as over 200 bp)
  some parts can't be read (?)
  - So, not-read part is located in gray part (?)

- Refernce sequence has "A"
Fragments have "C"
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:47:20.png
  - Meaning:
    - Point mutation (or A to C substitution variant)
    - Remaining parts are same to "reference sequence"

- there are continuous "empty" part
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:48:53.png
- This can be machine's error
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:49:15.png
- This is "deletion variant" (Indel: insertion and deletion variants)

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:51:46.png

Both (homozygous) are deletion variant

Depth 0

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:52:28.png

One is normal, one is deletion variant

Depth is 1/2

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:53:42.png

Depth is more

Gain (extra copy) variant

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:54:16.png

================================================================================
Reads are mapped to both chromosome1 and chromosome5
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_12_13:54:50.png

Cancer cell often shows this variant

chromosome1 and chromosome5 has fusion due to disease?

fusion point is called "translocation breakpoint"

================================================================================
Some fragments (like bateria or virus) are not mapped to human's reference sequence
