ChIP: [Ch]romatin [I]mmuno-[P]recipitation

================================================================================
Chromatin
- Status of DNA (which consists of chromosome) packed

Chromatin
- Complex structure with packed DNA, RNA, proteins, etc

DNA
- nucleosome -> chromatin -> chromosome

================================================================================
Our interest
- Interaction between "DNA" (which consists of chromatin) and "protein"
- You want to know "which sequence part of DNA" is coupled to "which protein"

================================================================================
ChIP-seq method

- You use "immuno" to precipitate the protein
- You sequence "brought DNA along with protein"
- You perform mapping "sequenced DNA" to reference genome
- Then, you can know the part where DNA and protein are coupled

================================================================================
ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project

- After human genome project in 2003
- you could know that there are 20000 genes which code protein
- you could know that 20000 genes are 2% out of entire genome
- 50% is repetitive sequence
- And other 48%? Is it junk DNA?
- 20000 genes are rather small number of genes
- junk DNA controls axons?

- ENCODE project, 2003
- junk DNA has controling part?
- target cell is 100 billions number of cells
- because gene-expression is different in cell to cell

- Various experimental tools
- chromatin structure
- open chromatin (DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq)
- histone modifications and DNA-biding of over 100 transcription factor (ChIP-seq)
- RNA transcription (RNAseq and CAGE)

DNA is coupled to protein

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_24_09:57:33.png

Cross-link between protein and DNA
- by using formaldehyde
- to create covalent bond between protein and DNA

- formaldehyde
- reaction between protein's amin group to formaldehyde
- it creates Schiff base
- covalent bond between DNA's amin group to protein's amin group  
- it doesn't break other covalent bond, it creates additional covalent bond
- incubation in 70 cecius degree, induced covalent bond disappear

There are much various proteins which can couple with DNA

You should select one protein

And you perform "antigen-antibody reaction"
for example, "antigen-antibody reaction" for transcription factor FOXA3 (protein)

================================================================================

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_24_10:12:27.png

- Perform "antigen-antibody reaction" for transcription factor FOXA3 (protein) and antibody

- You get NGS reads

- You perform mapping NGS reads to reference genome 

- You could know that NGS reads are much mapped to APOA2 gene part in 1st chromosome's reverse strand

================================================================================
Yellow: mapped result to forward strand
Blue: mapped result to reverse strand

DNA methylation: Me is attached to C

On histone protein: acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_24_11:02:48.png

CpG: Cytosine, Guanine

- CpG island: the place where CpG shows much more than normal

- Many gene's promoter has CpG island

- 5th location of Cytosine has high probability of methylation

- CpG's reverse complement is also CpG

- So, both strands (forward, reverse) have methylation

- DNA methylation is started by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzyme

- When methylation occurs in gene's promoter's CpG island, gene expression is surpressed

- There are 2 hypothesises about how methylation works

- methylated CpG island in promoter can prevent the transcription factor to bind to promoter

- Proteins (which have methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)) recognize methylated CpG
and proteins are attached to methylated CpG
They bring "histone deacetylase (HDAC)" or "chromatin remodeling proteins"
And they convert histone structure (chromatin) into heterochromatin which is more tightly packing DNA

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_24_11:21:31.png

- Use MBD protein (which recognize methylated-CpG island)

- You can know methylated part by using sequencing

- Like ChIP-seq, you cut DNA by using sonication

- You induce precipitation by using antiboty against MBD

- You perform sequencing

- You perform mapping sequenced DNA to genome reference

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_24_11:33:17.png

N: negative
- CCDC8 gene has no methylation

T: tumor
- CCDC8 gene has much methylation

CCDC8 gene has CpG island 

CCDC8 gene helps p53 which is cancer-surpressing gene

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_24_11:40:35.png

In the experiments using MBD protein,
you can't know sequenced DNA piece has methylation on which base

If you use bisulfite ($$$HSO_3^-$$$) on DNA,
Cytosine is converted Cytosinsulphonate -> Uracilsulphonate -> Uracil

On the other hand, 5-methylcytosine is not converted, but stay as it is

================================================================================

Histone protein:
4 kinds of protein
  - H2A, H2B, H3, H4
  - Entirely, 8 proteins (2*4)
  - 8 proteins become the core of nucleosome

Histone protein's branches can take chemicals, resulting in adjust of gene expression or other biological steps

================================================================================
/home/young/Pictures/2019_06_24_11:58:59.png

High signal in RNA polymerase II (PolII) : places where transcriptions are performed actively

H3 protein's 4th, 36th lysine amino acid branch's trimethylation signal is high

27th lysine trimethylation is low

This histone status is called "histone code"

Combination of "histone code" controls gene expression and other biological step
